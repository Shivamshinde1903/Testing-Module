register page:

1. division has only three options - A, B, C
2. roll number validation fails every time cause the value is passed as string instead of number
3. error messages while registering should be redesigned
4. The extra fields of email and invitation code are not being forced for teacher role, it's accepting the payload without these values
5. same collection used for students as well as teacher users
6. the validation of repeated users should be separated for students and teachers
7. same roll number students are allowed to register
8. same name should be allowed if the school/division/rollNo are different
